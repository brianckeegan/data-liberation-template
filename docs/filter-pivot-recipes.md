# Filter / Pivot Recipes — {{ project_name }}

> The processed CSV is **tidy long**: one row per observation, one
> column per variable. The wide views readers expect (year × variable
> matrices, source-comparison columns, geographic roll-ups) are
> generated on demand. This file is the cookbook.
>
> Recipes ship in three stacks — **Python/pandas**, **R/tidyverse**,
> and **SQL/DuckDB** — all reading the same canonical CSV at
> `data/processed/{{ project_slug }}.csv`. Pick the one that matches
> the consumer audience (**{{ consumer_stack }}** by default for this
> project). Add more stacks as common downstream uses emerge.

## Setup

### Python / pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(
    "data/processed/{{ project_slug }}.csv",
    dtype=str,  # safe default — coerce specific columns below
)

# Coerce numeric columns explicitly:
# df["votes"] = pd.to_numeric(df["votes"], errors="coerce")
```

### R / tidyverse

```r
library(readr); library(dplyr); library(tidyr)

df <- read_csv(
  "data/processed/{{ project_slug }}.csv",
  col_types = cols(.default = col_character())
)

# Coerce numeric columns explicitly:
# df <- df |> mutate(votes = as.integer(votes))
```

### SQL / DuckDB

```sql
-- Use the DuckDB CLI (`duckdb`), the `duckdb` Python package, or paste
-- straight into the published Datasette SQL editor (Datasette uses SQLite,
-- not DuckDB, but the SELECT/GROUP BY/PIVOT syntax below is portable for
-- everything except `read_csv()`; Datasette already has the data loaded).

-- For local DuckDB sessions, create a reusable view over the CSV so the
-- recipes below can just `FROM data` instead of repeating the path:
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW data AS
SELECT *
FROM read_csv(
  'data/processed/{{ project_slug }}.csv',
  -- Keep ID-like columns as text so leading zeros survive.
  types = {'observation_id': 'VARCHAR', 'vintage': 'VARCHAR', 'source': 'VARCHAR'}
);

-- Sanity check:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows, COUNT(DISTINCT source) AS sources FROM data;
```

## Recipe 1 — Single-vintage wide pivot

*"Show me 2024 only, one row per `observation_id`, with the
project's numeric columns side by side."*

### pandas

```python
v2024 = df.query("vintage == '2024'")

wide = v2024.pivot_table(
    index="observation_id",
    columns="source",                 # or whatever the categorical to spread is
    values="<numeric_column>",        # replace with the project's actual measure
    aggfunc="first",                  # or "sum" if rows can repeat
)
```

### tidyverse

```r
wide <- df |>
  filter(vintage == "2024") |>
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols     = observation_id,
    names_from  = source,
    values_from = `<numeric_column>`
  )
```

### DuckDB

```sql
-- DuckDB has a native PIVOT statement; the inner SELECT is the long form
-- you want to spread, the ON clause is the categorical that becomes columns.
PIVOT (
  SELECT observation_id, source, "<numeric_column>"
  FROM data
  WHERE vintage = '2024'
)
ON source
USING first("<numeric_column>");  -- or SUM(...) if rows can repeat
```

---

## Recipe 2 — Year × source matrix of counts

*"How many rows from each source, in each vintage?"* This is what
the audit report shows you, but generated on demand for slicing
by reader.

### pandas

```python
counts = (
    df.groupby(["vintage", "source"])
      .size()
      .unstack("source", fill_value=0)
      .sort_index()
)
```

### tidyverse

```r
counts <- df |>
  count(vintage, source) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = source, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) |>
  arrange(vintage)
```

### DuckDB

```sql
PIVOT (
  SELECT vintage, source FROM data
)
ON source
USING count(*)
GROUP BY vintage
ORDER BY vintage;
```

## Recipe 3 — Roll up to a coarser geography

*"Aggregate from precinct to district (or county, or state)."*
Requires a crosswalk under `data/lookups/`. The pattern is the
same regardless of the specific geography — left-join the crosswalk,
group, aggregate.

### pandas

```python
# Suppose data/lookups/precinct_to_district.csv has columns: precinct, district
crosswalk = pd.read_csv("data/lookups/precinct_to_district.csv", dtype=str)

district_totals = (
    df.merge(crosswalk, on="precinct", how="left")
      .groupby(["vintage", "district"])
      ["<numeric_column>"]
      .sum()
      .reset_index()
)
```

### tidyverse

```r
crosswalk <- read_csv("data/lookups/precinct_to_district.csv",
                      col_types = cols(.default = col_character()))

district_totals <- df |>
  left_join(crosswalk, by = "precinct") |>
  group_by(vintage, district) |>
  summarise(total = sum(as.integer(`<numeric_column>`), na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = "drop")
```

### DuckDB

```sql
SELECT
  d.vintage,
  c.district,
  SUM(TRY_CAST(d."<numeric_column>" AS BIGINT)) AS total
FROM data d
LEFT JOIN read_csv(
    'data/lookups/precinct_to_district.csv',
    types = {'precinct': 'VARCHAR', 'district': 'VARCHAR'}
  ) c
  USING (precinct)
GROUP BY d.vintage, c.district
ORDER BY d.vintage, c.district;
```

## Recipe 4 — Cross-source concept comparison

*"For every observation_id where source A and source B both
report the same `concept`, show both values side by side."*

This is what the `concept` column is for. Sources that name the
same underlying thing differently are harmonized via
`data/lookups/concepts.yaml`; this recipe is the payoff.

### pandas

```python
compare = (
    df.dropna(subset=["concept"])
      .pivot_table(
          index=["vintage", "observation_id", "concept"],
          columns="source",
          values="<value_column>",
          aggfunc="first",
      )
      .reset_index()
)
```

### tidyverse

```r
compare <- df |>
  filter(!is.na(concept)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols     = c(vintage, observation_id, concept),
    names_from  = source,
    values_from = `<value_column>`
  )
```

### DuckDB

```sql
PIVOT (
  SELECT vintage, observation_id, concept, source, "<value_column>"
  FROM data
  WHERE concept IS NOT NULL
)
ON source
USING first("<value_column>");
```

## Why long-then-pivot, not wide-as-primary

The tidy long format is the project's contract. Wide is a view.
The reasons:

- **New vintages don't change the schema.** A new year of data is
  new rows, not new columns. Wide-as-primary forces a column-add
  every refresh; tidy-long doesn't.
- **The same canonical CSV serves every downstream use.** A
  pandas notebook, an R analysis, a SQL load, a Datasette
  publish — all of them read the same file.
- **Auditing is uniform.** `audit.py` reports null rates per
  column. In wide layouts, "null rate of `votes_2017`" is a
  different question from "null rate of `votes_2018`"; in tidy
  long, "null rate of `votes`" is the question, and any vintage
  imbalance shows up in source coverage.

There are exceptions — see `references/data-modeling.md` ("When
wide-as-primary is OK") in the data-liberation skill. CVR-style
ballot-image data is the canonical case. But the default is long.
