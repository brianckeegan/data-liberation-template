{{ description }}

A reproducible data-liberation pipeline producing a tidy long-form
dataset from public sources, with provenance, audit reports, an
interactive [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) instance, and a
methodology site rendered with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) on
GitHub Pages.

## A peek at the data

| source | vintage | observation_id | concept | ... |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| example | 2023 | a | temperature | ... |
| example | 2023 | b | temperature | ... |
| example | 2024 | c | _(null)_ | ... |

Full schema in [`docs/data-dictionary.md`](docs/data-dictionary.md);
sample recipes for Python/pandas, R/tidyverse, and SQL/DuckDB in
[`docs/filter-pivot-recipes.md`](docs/filter-pivot-recipes.md).

## How to use it

### Browse it

The published Datasette instance is at:

> **`https://{{ project_slug }}.vercel.app/`** *(replace with your actual URL after first deploy)*

Click into the `{{ project_slug }}` table to browse. The faceting on
the left filters by `source`, `vintage`, and other categorical
columns; the SQL editor at the top runs arbitrary queries; every
view has a `.csv` and `.json` sibling for downstream tooling.

### Read about it

The methodology site at
**`https://{{ owner }}.github.io/{{ project_slug }}/`** has:

- A long-form data dictionary with vintage breakpoints and caveats
- How the pipeline extracts and reconciles each source
- Per-vintage changelog
- Citation guidance

### Python / pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(
    "data/processed/{{ project_slug }}.csv",
    dtype=str,  # safe default — coerce specific columns explicitly below
)

# Coerce numeric columns where the schema declares them numeric:
# df["votes"] = pd.to_numeric(df["votes"], errors="coerce")

# Or pull directly from the published instance:
# df = pd.read_csv("https://{{ project_slug }}.vercel.app/{{ project_slug }}/{{ project_slug }}.csv?_size=max")
```

### R / tidyverse

```r
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

df <- read_csv(
  "data/processed/{{ project_slug }}.csv",
  col_types = cols(.default = col_character())
)

# Coerce numeric columns explicitly:
# df <- df |> mutate(votes = as.integer(votes))

# Or pull directly from the published instance:
# df <- read_csv("https://{{ project_slug }}.vercel.app/{{ project_slug }}/{{ project_slug }}.csv?_size=max")
```

### SQL / DuckDB

```sql
-- Query the CSV directly — no load step, no schema definition needed.
-- Use the DuckDB CLI, the duckdb Python package, or paste into the
-- published Datasette SQL editor.

SELECT *
FROM read_csv('data/processed/{{ project_slug }}.csv')
LIMIT 5;

-- DuckDB infers types, which can lose leading zeros on ID-like columns.
-- Pin string-typed columns explicitly when leading zeros matter:
SELECT *
FROM read_csv(
  'data/processed/{{ project_slug }}.csv',
  types = {'observation_id': 'VARCHAR', 'vintage': 'VARCHAR'}
)
LIMIT 5;
```

### Find stories in it

The dataset is the input to a separate craft — finding the story, sanity-checking the finding, and writing it without overclaiming. The [*New York Times* data-training materials](https://github.com/nytimes/data-training) are the canonical newsroom reference for that practice: brainstorming story angles from a dataset, verification habits that prevent common misreadings, and editorial review of data stories. The materials are Google-Sheets-first (the [Google Sheets cheat sheets](https://github.com/nytimes/data-training/tree/master/Google-sheets-cheat-sheets) translate cleanly to the pandas / R / DuckDB recipes above), but the *methodological* content — especially [*How-Not-To-Be-Wrong*](https://github.com/nytimes/data-training/blob/master/Various-tip-sheets/How-Not-To-Be-Wrong.docx) and [*Data-Stories-Brainstorming-Guide*](https://github.com/nytimes/data-training/blob/master/Various-tip-sheets/Data-Stories-Brainstorming-Guide.docx) — is what makes a story honest. This project's data dictionary, provenance sidecar, and caveats sections are the *inputs* to that practice; the practice itself is downstream.

## Movement context

This project participates in a longer tradition of public-interest
data liberation: the Sunlight Foundation's mid-2010s push to make
government data machine-readable; the [PUDL](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/)
energy-data project; the Boulder Public Data
[Election-Results](https://github.com/BoulderPublicData/Election-Results)
and adjacent repos. See the `data-liberation` Claude skill's
`references/movement-history.md` for the broader landscape.

## Reproducibility

Everything is reproducible from clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{{ owner }}/{{ project_slug }}.git
cd {{ project_slug }}
git lfs install                                     # if not already
git lfs pull                                        # pull large files
uv sync                                             # install Python deps
uv run python -m scripts.pipeline run               # rebuild data/processed/
```

The same input produces an identical SQLite file; that's the
[Baked Data](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/)
pattern.

## Refresh schedule

Configured via `.github/workflows/refresh.yml` (rename from
`.disabled` to enable). Default cadence: weekly on Mondays at
13:00 UTC. Each successful refresh opens a PR with the new audit;
merging triggers re-deploy of both the Datasette instance and the
methodology site.

## Governance

Civic-data projects publish information about people, institutions, and
systems whose interests aren't always aligned with publication. This
project commits to the following:

- **Source license is honored.** The upstream publisher's terms, where
  applicable, are documented in `data/processed/provenance.csv` and
  propagate forward; the CC-BY license above applies to the
  *project's* transformations, not to upstream content.
- **PII redaction at the publish boundary.** The originals retain
  whatever the publisher published; the processed CSV obeys this
  project's redaction policy, documented per column in
  `docs/data-dictionary.md` under each variable's *Known caveats*.
- **Out-of-scope uses.** The maintainers do not endorse downstream
  uses for enforcement, predictive policing, eviction targeting, or
  immigration enforcement. (Customize this list to the dataset's
  actual subject matter.)
- **Error-reporting path.** Open a GitHub issue using the *Data
  correction* template; corrections are logged in
  `docs/changelog.qmd` with the affected vintages named and
  propagated on the next refresh — never silently rewritten.
- **Vintage tagging for citation.** Each refresh ships under a
  GitHub Release tag (e.g., `v2026.05.01`); cite that tag if you
  want the dataset you cited to remain stable.

See `references/project-template.md#governance` in the
`data-liberation` Claude skill for the full governance checklist.
